For question 1, use "int number = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);" as mentioned to get the entire string of digits.
Use modulus and division by 10 to get the individual digits.

When creating if else statements, watch our for the following:

	If your method needs to return a double, make sure that it will always return a double in every scenario.
	If you create your own variables, note that they are only existent in their blocks.
	
	if (x > y) {
		double max = x;
	} else if (x < y) {
		double max = y;
	}
	return max;
	
	will not work as the double max no longer exists after the if else.
	Either return the values without creating new variables within the blocks itself,
	or initiate the double (ie double max = new Double();) before the if else statements.
	
	If your if else crashed and you see no syntax error, there is a chance that you didn't take into account every scenario,
	(like the example above), and there is some value in which nothing is returned.
